## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

Since this is a security tool, we take security seriously:

### Security Review Process

- All contributions undergo security review
- Potential vulnerabilities are privately disclosed
- Security-critical changes require additional review

### Responsible Disclosure

If you find a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email us privately at [security-email]
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for us to address the issue before public disclosure

## üíª Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include docstrings for functions and classes

### Python Conventions

```python
def analyze_image_metadata(file_path: str, analysis_level: str = "quick") -> dict:
    """
    Analyze image metadata for potential threats.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the image file
        analysis_level: Level of analysis (quick, deep, ultra)
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If file_path is invalid
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Frontend Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5
- Maintain responsive design
- Follow existing CSS class naming conventions
- Test across different browsers
- Ensure accessibility standards

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify security implications
- Test on different file types and scenarios

```python
# Example test structure
import unittest
from image_threat_scanner import analyze_image_metadata

class TestImageAnalysis(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_image_analysis(self):
        # Test with valid image
        result = analyze_image_metadata("test_images/clean.jpg")
        self.assertEqual(result['status'], 'clean')
        
    def test_invalid_file_path(self):
        # Test error handling
        with self.assertRaises(FileNotFoundError):
            analyze_image_metadata("nonexistent.jpg")
```

## üîç Detection Algorithm Contributions

### Adding New Detection Methods

1. **Create Detection Function**

   ```python
   def detect_new_threat_type(file_path: str) -> list:
       """
       Detect specific type of threat in image.
       
       Returns:
           List of findings/threats detected
       """
       findings = []
       # Implementation
       return findings
   ```

2. **Integrate into Main Scanner**
   - Add to appropriate analysis level in `image_threat_scanner.py`
   - Follow existing pattern for error handling
   - Ensure proper categorization (threat/warning/clean)

3. **Add YARA Rules** (if applicable)

   ```yara
   rule New_Threat_Pattern {
       meta:
           description = "Detects new threat pattern"
           author = "Your Name"
           date = "2025-01-01"
       strings:
           $pattern = "threat_indicator"
       condition:
           any of them
   }
   ```

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize false positives
- Consider computational complexity
- Test with large files and datasets
- Provide configurable thresholds where appropriate

## üìù Pull Request Process

   # Manual testing with various file types
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Add/update docstrings
   - Update README if needed
   - Add to CHANGELOG.md
   - Include usage examples

3. **Code Quality Check**

   flake8 .
   
   # Security check
   bandit -r .
   ```
